  <h2>Inline Elements</h2>
  <p>
    This is a paragraph with multiple inline elements. The <span>span</span> is not styled,
    but you may have <a href="#">some links with the a tag</a>; also you can
    <em>add emphasis with em</em> or <i>also with i</i>; Highlight the words by
    <strong>using strong</strong> or just <b>bring attention with the b tag</b>; of course, 
    you can <s>strikethrough text</s> (or use the deprecated tag in HTML5:
    <strike>strike</strike>), and the <code>&lt;u&gt;</code> tag now stands for
    <u>unarticullated-text</u> instead of underline; abbreviations are great, as you may have
    <abbr title="too many abbreviations">TMA</abbr>; <code>inline code</code> is cool too;
    You can also add line breask with br...<br />
    <mark>Highlight text with mark</mark> or display a <kbd>Key</kbd>. You can also have
    <q>inline quotes with q</q>, or <samp>results from an operation with samp</samp> or a
    <var>variable</var>, or an <output>output</output>, also there's <small>small text</small>, text
    with<sup>superscript</sup>, or text with<sub>subscript</sub>... not to mention you can
    have time too. For example, this paragraph was originally written in <time>2020</time>.
    Not to forget about <dfn>definitions</dfn>! Also <del>del was deleted</del> and 
    <ins>ins was inserted</ins>.
